# Robin Assistent

Robin Assistent is an application where caregivers can set up daily activities for their clients. The clients can then carry out these activities via an easy step-by-step plan. These are tasks that are normal for us, such as brushing our teeth and taking a shower. But for the clients it is much more difficult. Robin Assistent makes this much easier for them!
